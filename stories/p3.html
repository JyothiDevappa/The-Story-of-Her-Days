  <h1>A Perfect Rainy Tale üåßÔ∏è‚ú®</h1>

  <p>It was a dark rainy day. The sky was crying like it broke up with the sun. I was sitting near my window, just watching the rain like a lazy detective staring at life. The raindrops were not normal ‚Äî they were falling like they had no brakes. And the nearby trees? Oh god, they were dancing like no one was watching ‚Äî full energy mode ON. It felt like they were doing Garba in the rain just to show off.</p>

  <blockquote>"So peaceful. So calm. So sleepy."</blockquote>

  <p>And then ‚Äî <em>my tummy betrayed me</em>. A little hunger popped in, whispering, <strong>‚ÄúJo, feed me or I‚Äôll cry louder than this thunder.‚Äù</strong></p>

  <p>So I stood up like a soldier on a mission. Went down to borrow an umbrella from my friend (because I‚Äôm not a rainproof human). Then I ran to the nearby shop ‚Äî not for pizza, not for burger, but for the king of comfort food ‚Äî <strong>Maggi!</strong></p>

  <p>I came back with the Maggi packet like it was a treasure. Then I went to our PG‚Äôs cooking uncle and said, ‚ÄúUncle, please give me the Maggi tools.‚Äù Uncle didn‚Äôt ask anything, he just gave what I needed ‚Äî like a magician handing over spells.</p>

  <p>I went to the kitchen and started cooking with full emotion ‚Äî like I was in MasterChef. After the masterpiece was ready, I put it in a bowl like it was gold. But wait ‚Äî something was missing. Yes! <em>Tea!</em> How can a rainy day feel complete without tea?</p>

  <p>Again, I went to the tea shop, bought one parcel tea, came back like a rain-soaked champion, climbed the stairs, reached my room, sat on my bed with my hot Maggi and tea. Then, I stared out the window. The sound of rain, the breeze, the smell of Maggi ‚Äî that moment was <strong>*10/10 no cap*</strong>.</p>

  <blockquote>"Hot Maggi, sweet tea, rain outside ‚Äî heaven unlocked!"</blockquote>

  <p>I took one spoon of Maggi, one sip of tea. Heaven! But my brain said, <strong>‚ÄúYou need background music.‚Äù</strong> So I opened YouTube and typed: <em>Heidi cartoon</em>. Because nothing beats childhood happiness.</p>

  <p>The intro started ‚Äî ‚ÄúHeidi, Heidi‚Ä¶‚Äù and boom! I was a child again. My heart smiled. Heidi was lying on the cloud, watching the world like a soft spy.</p>

  <blockquote>"I also wanted to lie on a cloud and watch people."</blockquote>

  <p>But then my brain laughed and said, <em>‚ÄúJo, stop dreaming, you will fall down and break your back.‚Äù</em></p>

  <p>Still, I watched that cartoon with my whole heart. Heidi‚Äôs world is a dream. She lives with her grandpa in a cute wooden house, in the middle of the mountains. No people, no noise, just green grass, goats, birds, and peaceful silence. So cozy. So clean. No city stress. No ‚ÄúWhat's your CTC?‚Äù Only happiness.</p>

  <blockquote>"Just trees, tea, Maggi, and peace. That's the dream."</blockquote>

  <p>She has a best friend, Peter, and a lovely dog. And Heidi herself? She is a full power girl. Always jumping, running, doing something. Never sitting quietly like us during lectures. That‚Äôs why I love her ‚Äî she enjoys every little moment.</p>

  <p>That cartoon made me think ‚Äî I also want a life like that. No traffic, no Instagram. Just freedom and nature.</p>

  <p><strong>"Suddenly, lights went off ‚Äî fan stopped. But who cares? The rain was already giving free AC."</p></strong>

  <p>And that‚Äôs how I spent a perfect rainy day. With hot Maggi, sweet tea, childhood memories, and Heidi's smiling face on the screen ‚Äî while my dreams floated somewhere in the clouds with her.</p>

  <p><strong>The End.</strong> (But also, <em>*To Be Continued*, whenever it rains again!)</em></p>

    <h1>When Mornings Remember Me</h1>

  <p>I woke up early today... and honestly? It felt like heaven.</p>
  <p>I went down to the ground floor and there he was — our PG cooking uncle, already making tea. The moment he saw me, he poured one cup and gave it to me. He’s not just a cook anymore, he’s the tea master. He’s also become my friend.</p>

  <blockquote>If I had to rate his tea? Full 5 stars! One sip, and my sleepy brain was like, “System activated!”</blockquote>

  <p>After finishing tea I stepped outside. The world felt different. The sun kissed me with warm sunlight and a chill breeze, and the trees were doing slow-mo dances.</p>

  <blockquote>Waking up early… it gives a fresh mind. A clean start.</blockquote>

  <p>But the bitter truth about me? I mostly waste time thinking about what I should do instead of actually doing it. (Relatable 1000%.)</p>

  <p>When I was about to enter Nandanavana Park, the vibe just hit back. Birds were singing — like a Spotify playlist with no ads. I had missed this vibe… it’s been so long since I woke up early, I almost forgot mornings existed.</p>

  <p>I kept walking and saw some uncles reading newspapers. A few uncles had old songs playing on their phones, walking like heroes in a slow-motion movie. And suddenly, I remembered my old days...</p>

  <blockquote>My mom, sharp at 6 a.m., used to play songs on the FM. Back then I was like, “Ahhh, again??” But now… it feels like sweet nostalgia.</blockquote>

  <p>Everyone was doing exercise and yoga. When I saw the aunties in the park, some were working out like fitness champions — zero laziness. But a few? They were deep in gossip mode. I felt like they totally forgot why they even came. Did they really wake up early just to exercise their mouths instead of their bodies?</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, a few professional uncles were like:</p>
  <blockquote>“My son’s going abroad,” “I just gifted him a car,” “Which property should I buy next?”</blockquote>
  
  <p>And I was like,</p>
  <blockquote>“Uncle, why not send him to Mars with a suitcase?”</blockquote>

  <p>After hearing those professional-level life updates, I didn’t want to spoil my morning mood. So, I quietly sat in the middle of the park on a bench, hoping for peace. But nope — another round of uncle group discussion was already on. I was like, “Now what’s going on?”</p>

  <p>One uncle suddenly went full Shakespeare mode:</p>
  <blockquote>“Health is more important than money.”</blockquote>

  <p>But some other uncles — probably the ones without much money — started saying,</p>
  <blockquote>“No sir, money is everything! If we have money, we can buy health too.”</blockquote>

  <p>Then the wise uncle hit back with a real story:</p>
  <blockquote>He shared about a friend who had it all — car, house, properties — but he was sick, couldn’t do anything on his own, and ended his life.</blockquote>

  <p>That hit hard.</p>

  <p>When it comes to our side's morning routine...</p>

  <p>Sometimes, I randomly wake up at 6 a.m., step outside, and there’s my mom — already cleaning the front yard, sprinkling water, and putting rangoli. The moment she saw me awake — she paused like time stopped and said,</p>

  <blockquote>“You woke up early? Today it might rain for sure!”</blockquote>

  <p>Or worse…</p>
  <blockquote>“Sun might rise from the west today!” 😄</blockquote>

  <p>Right across our house, there's this one legendary old lady. Wakes up at 4 a.m. sharp. Cleans her yard with full energy. But her actual job? Full-time gossiping. I swear she knows every family drama in the area.</p>

  <blockquote>Certified CBI agent of the street.</blockquote>

  <p>People heading to the dairy for milk, some curdling it at home, and the hardworking ones already in the fields doing farming work. Everyone’s busy with their own morning routine.</p>

  <p>In our house, we’ve got a tap, so no need to run around for water. But others? As soon as the tap turns on, everyone runs with pots… and boom — the real drama begins.</p>

  <p>After this mini tap drama, the street slowly cools down…</p>

  <p>And in our house, my mom starts making the perfect tea. That moment?</p>

  <blockquote>Pure peace.</blockquote>

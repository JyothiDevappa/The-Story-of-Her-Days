    <h1>Your Kindness Needs Limits</h1>

    <p>Kindness is beautiful, but only when it‚Äôs respected. I‚Äôve seen how people treat you when you‚Äôre too kind, too open, too available. They start taking you for granted. They stop listening. They act like your emotions are a burden.</p>

    <p>At first, I blamed them. I wondered, ‚ÄúWhy are they treating me like I don‚Äôt matter? Why do they ignore me when I‚Äôve done nothing wrong?‚Äù But slowly, I realized‚Äî</p>

    <p>It wasn‚Äôt just them. It was me. I allowed them that space. I gave them permission to treat me that way.</p>

    <p>I shared my purest self with people who didn‚Äôt even deserve my time. I gave my energy to those who only saw me as someone to control or blame. I stayed when I should‚Äôve walked away. I smiled through pain, hoping they‚Äôd see my heart. But they never did.</p>

    <p>And when I was finally alone, I noticed the bitter truth‚ÄîIf you‚Äôre alone and have nothing to offer, people rarely care. They remember you only when they need something. Silence taught me more than words ever could.</p>

    <p>That‚Äôs why setting boundaries is not rude‚Äîit‚Äôs necessary. Stop explaining yourself to those who never try to understand. Don‚Äôt let people use your kindness as a weakness.</p>

    <p>Protect your peace. Honor your time. Give yourself to those who genuinely value you. The rest will fade away, and honestly‚Äîthey should.</p>

    <p>When you limit your words, when you don‚Äôt overshare, people treat you differently. They respect you more. They stop using you. And that‚Äôs when you realize‚Äîyou are not meant for everyone. You are meant for the few who see your worth without needing to be reminded of it.</p>

    <p>And those few? They make it all worth it. So protect your softness, but don‚Äôt hand it out carelessly. Because the right ones will never make you feel wrong for being kind.</p>

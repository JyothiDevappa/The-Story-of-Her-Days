    <h1>Maybe I Was the Answer</h1>
    
    <p>Some days, my mind spins with so many thoughts—loud, messy, and desperate for answers. And yet… I find none.</p>
    <p>I try to explain what’s going on inside me to someone—hoping for clarity, guidance, or just to be heard—but their words? They don’t help. They don’t understand.</p>
    <p>I was standing there, holding back tears, wondering how something so small could feel so heavy.</p>

    <p>And then, frustration took over. God, I gave everything I had—my time, my energy, my soul—and still, the result? Not what I wanted. Not what I imagined.</p>

    <blockquote>“You’re not good enough for this. You’ll never be.”</blockquote>

    <p>I kept asking myself—why? Why does it come so easily for others? Why do I have so many ideas, and yet, I can’t bring them to life? Why does it always feel like I’m chasing something I’ll never catch?</p>

    <p>Even when I pour all of me into a dream, I end up hearing the same thing:</p>

    <blockquote>“You need to learn more. You’re still not there.”</blockquote>

    <p>It hurts. I’m not patient. I want results, and I want them to match the effort I gave. But they don’t. Not always. And when they don’t, I break down. Cry. Then… breathe.</p>

    <p>So I walk. Just a few minutes. Just to feel the sky, the wind, anything that doesn’t ask me questions.</p>

    <p>Then I come back. A strong tea in hand. I sit. And I start again.</p>

    <p>Because the truth? The wise ones were right. Try again.</p>

    <p>And this time—what I made? It was better. Far better. Beyond what I expected.</p>

    <p>So no, I may not have patience. But I have hunger. And sometimes, that’s enough to fight back against that voice.</p>

    <p>I’ve learned something: You won’t always find answers in others. You won’t always get a solution when you ask. But maybe, sometimes—you are the solution.</p>

    <p class="final">So if you feel stuck, broken, or not enough—<br />
    Take a break. Don’t quit. Start again.</p>

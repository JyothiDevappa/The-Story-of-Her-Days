    <h1>The Truth About Giving Advice</h1>
    
    <p>Sometimes, we feel the urge to advise people around us. Not because we think we're better than them, but because we genuinely care.</p>
    
    <p class="quote">“Advice is only valuable when the listener is ready to hear it.”</p>

    <p>There were times I gave advice with a good heart, simply because I didn’t want someone to make the same mistake I did. But they didn’t take it seriously. They ignored it. That ignorance, that rejection—yes, it made me angry.</p>

    <p>And then I remembered… I’ve done the same.</p>

    <p>I’ve neglected my brother’s advice countless times. Even when he was right, I refused to listen. I thought he was trying to control me. But all he was trying to do was show me the reality of life. He cared about my career, my future.</p>

    <p class="quote">“People who advise us aren’t always trying to show off—they’re often the ones who’ve already been through the pain we’re walking into.”</p>

    <p>I used to ignore those words. I didn’t respect them. I felt like, “Why should I listen to them?” But now, when I advise someone and they ignore it—I feel that same hurt.</p>

    <p>It made me realize:</p>

    <p class="quote">“People only understand the value of advice after facing the same situation themselves.”</p>

    <p>That’s when it hits. When you're stuck, when you're helpless, when you don’t know what to do next. That’s when someone else’s experience becomes gold.</p>

    <p>So here’s what I’ve learned: If someone gives you advice—even if you’re not in the mood to hear it—just smile and say, “Okay, I’ll think about it.” Don’t argue. Don’t make them feel small.</p>

    <p class="quote">“People who give advice do it because they care. Not because they think they know everything.”</p>

    <p>Some people have already crossed the phase you're struggling in. That’s why they know the pressure, the pain, and the steps that follow. They’re not giving you philosophy—they’re offering you direction, from their scars.</p>

    <p>Today, when someone argued with my advice, I didn’t feel angry. I felt sad. Because now I understand how it works in reality.</p>

    <p>Nobody is perfect. But when someone tells you the truth—even if it's uncomfortable—don’t ignore it. That truth might save you tomorrow.</p>

    <p class="final-quote">“You won’t get it—until you go through it.”</p>

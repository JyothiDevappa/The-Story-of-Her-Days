    <h1>Better Together💛</h1>

    <p>Every trio has its rhythm —<br>
    One talks a lot, one listens deeply, and the third just vibes.</p>

    <p>For me, it all started in the last four months of college.<br>
    A short time? Yes.<br>
    But what we lived in those days — that felt like a lifetime.</p>

    <p>
      Before them, I never had a friendship like that.
      People heard me before, sure — but no one actually listened.
      But these two? Oh, they heard everything — even my overthinking.
    </p>

    <p>Let me talk about my two girls.</p>

    <p>One queen has curly hair — she’s an extrovert. She had a scooty, a laugh louder than her ringtone.
    She always wore kajal in her eyes — like she was giving an advertisement for it every day. 😄</p>

    <p>She lived near our hostel. No matter what her mother said, if I was feeling low — especially during that never-ending hostel warden drama — she’d still show up.</p>

    <p>
      She wasn’t going to solve my problems, but just riding around with her — wind in my face and laughter in my ears — was enough to forget everything.
    </p>

    <blockquote>She always matched my energy — movies, songs, dance... everything.</blockquote>

    <p>Every morning, she’d come to pick me up for college. I was always late, but she never complained.
    she always captured my moments on Snapchat — like it was our own little series.</p>

    <p>The other one? Total opposite.</p>

    <p>She had long, silky hair. Quiet. Introverted. She wouldn’t even go to the hotel alone. She seemed like someone who’d never talk to anyone — but with me? She did.
    Her nails were always sharp, and she was always rocking some new, stylish dress. Total modern girl vibes — not saree-type, but definitely a girly vibe. 😄</p>

    <p>
      She loved me the most,<br>
      Every day after college, we were like foodies on a mission — eating golgappas outside.
    </p>

    <p>I always used to tell her,<br>
    “Talk more, go outside, don’t be so shy!”</p>

    <p>
      And now?? She’s out there talking to everyone, eating alone, walking like Miss Independent.
      I’m like — hellooo madam, slow down!
      You weren’t even going to the hotel alone back then, and now you’re out here like a heroine in her solo movie 😭.
    </p>

    <h3>three of us together? Different energy altogether.</h3>

    <p>There was the stone.<br>
    Yes — a stone.<br>
    Not a bench, not a fancy table. Just a big, wide stone under a huge tree in our college campus. That was our place.</p>

    <p>Every break, every lunch, every stolen hour — we sat there.
    Played songs, talked about everything and nothing, clicked silly pictures, and shared whatever food someone had in their bag.</p>

    <p>
      Before them? I sat on that stone alone.
      It felt like a dead place — just cold and empty.
      I was lonely, like background music in a sad movie.</p>

    <blockquote>But with them, that same spot became our happy place — full of laughter, music, and nonstop nonsense.</blockquote>

    <p>
      "I still remember that day — the three of us went for a ride, laughing like there was no tomorrow. 
      We stopped at a hotel, they ordered set dosa, not because they liked it, but just because I did.
      That moment showed me how much they cared — choosing my favourite over theirs, just to see me smile.
    </p>
    <blockquote>Real friendship feels like that — warm, simple, and full of love." 😊✨</blockquote>
